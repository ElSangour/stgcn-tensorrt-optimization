# GCN_Pytorch2TRT_Optimization
This Repo contains an unofficial Model Optimization for GCNs neural network ( Graph Convolutional Network) to TensorRT.
In this repo we will implement a high-performance ST-GCN (Spatial Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks) implementation optimized for NVIDIA Jetson NX using PyTorch-to-TensorRT conversion.
